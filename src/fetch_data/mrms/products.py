"""MRMS product registry.

MRMS (Multi-Radar/Multi-Sensor, NOAA/NSSL) CONUS products are 0.01 deg lat/lon grids of
7000 x 3500 cells (lon 230.005..299.995 E, lat 54.995..20.005 N, north-up), GRIB2 with
PNG packing, one gzipped file per valid time.

Time convention: the file time stamp is the *valid time*. For accumulations
(``*_QPE_*``) this is the END of the accumulation window, e.g. the 01H file stamped
12:00 holds rain from 11:00 to 12:00 UTC.

Missing data: ``-3`` = no radar coverage; other negative codes (``-1``, ``-999``) =
missing. All negatives become NaN when read (see ``PrecipFlag`` for its categories).
